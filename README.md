###### Client Changes
- added all new market data code from Dreadful's fork manually into this version. Seems to work. It also added a loading bar to startup.

#### 4/14/2025
- updated sdk.cs for new patch 16.5.6.36217
- All features tested & working on SLIM. Sometimes tarkov.dev rate-limits me but other than we're good.
