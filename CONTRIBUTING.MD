# DON'T 100% TRUST AI CODE HELPERS / GENERATORS!!!!!!!!!!
They make plenty of mistakes and often times give the worst possible solution to a problem. If you use AI, Say what it was used for and where in your code. If you don't personally understand what the AI has done for you, consider attempting to understand before submitting code to this repo. If you cannot for some reason understand, submit what you have but explain where it's confusing and what the AI helped you do. I will determine if it's worth while to accept.

### AI code helpers are typically dog water but sometimes Cursor IDE can figure out logic mistakes or find small errors.
